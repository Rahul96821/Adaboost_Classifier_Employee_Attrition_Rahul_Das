Predicting which employees are likely to leave allows HR departments to take proactive measures to improve retention and maintain organizational stability.\n","\n","This project focuses on analyzing an HR dataset containing employee demographics, job-related attributes, and workplace information to predict employee attrition. The dataset includes both numerical features (such as Age, DistanceFromHome, TotalWorkingYears) and categorical features (such as Department, JobRole, OverTime), which are preprocessed and used as inputs for machine learning models.\n","\n","The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether an employee is likely to stay or leave.

Attrition project aimed to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization using historical employee data.

After training and testing the model:\n","\n","The accuracy achieved was 86.4%, indicating that the model can correctly classify employees’ attrition status in the majority of cases.\n","\n","The confusion matrix revealed that the model predicts employees who stay (non-attrition) very well but has some difficulty predicting actual attrition cases, which is typical in imbalanced datasets.\n","\n","Overall, the model demonstrates that machine learning can be effectively leveraged to identify employees at risk of leaving, enabling HR departments to implement proactive retention strategies. Further improvements could include addressing class imbalance (e.g., using SMOTE), feature selection, and experimenting with other advanced models like XGBoost or Random Forest for potentially higher predictive performance."],"metadata":{"id":"S9BRaxuOiS1d"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"2sxsSvqcWj92","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756701035953,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Rahul Das","userId":"10605675281746257009"}}},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]}]}
